Code Description:
The code asks the user to input which row of Pascal's Triangle they would like to view.
Note that the top row is row number 1.

Once given a row is given, the a vector "line" is created which will store the desired line of Pascal's triangle.
A while loop is used to add values in order to this "line" list by using an (n choose k) equation based on the 
row and index number.

At the end, the row the user wanted is printed out.
